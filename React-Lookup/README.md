# React lookup webapp 

This case study is about building a web application, for the purpose of looking up different users/people in an external API and displaying it nicely on the screen with the help of a component library.

The case is simple, use React to set up a web app to look up names from an external API and show the paginated (optional) result that the API sends you. Only constraints is it must be a React app, using a component library (Material UI or alike), and it must use the external API.

NB. Last time I tried to boot up this old case study, the API used to fetch users were unreachable. Perhaps they shut it down?
