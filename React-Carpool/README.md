# React carpool webapp 

This case study is about building a web application, for the purpose of having an overview over the carpool between 4 different people. Namely "MR", "JL", "AC", "CJ".

The case is simple, use React to set up an overview over all the carpools with you (you being whoever one of the four people you choose) as a driver, and as a passenger. Each trip should show a little bit of basic information about it. Also show when the last time was you drove, the last time you were a passenger, and number of trips as passenger/driver.

I recieved a carpools.json file, being my data source for the project. This file is not made by me.
